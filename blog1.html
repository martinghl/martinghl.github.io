            As I sit with these thoughts, I find myself at a crossroads—not the first I’ve encountered, but perhaps the most profound. The act of applying for PhD programs is not just a step forward; it’s a quiet reckoning with everything that has led me here.

            My life, like anyone’s, is a mosaic of leaps. Some were calculated, others made with trembling hands. Moving to the U.S. at 15, with a suitcase and no language to call my own, was one of the first. I remember the silence of not knowing how to ask for what I needed, the weight of words I couldn’t yet speak. It was disorienting, but it was also formative. Resilience, I learned, isn’t built in triumph—it’s forged in those quiet, uncertain moments when you decide to try again.

            Over the years, my path has curved in unexpected ways. What began with numbers—rigid, predictable—expanded into questions about people, systems, and the stories hidden in data. I didn’t plan to end up here, but perhaps that’s the beauty of it: the unexpected reveals the things that matter most.

            This work is more than research. It’s a way of asking the world questions and waiting patiently for it to answer. It’s the joy of discovery balanced by the humility of knowing there’s still so much I don’t understand. Every step I’ve taken, from modeling to guiding students through statistical syntax, has been a quiet lesson in the value of perseverance and curiosity.

            I don’t know what the next chapter holds, but I know this: the leap is worth it. It always has been.
